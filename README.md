# Table editor for LeetCode tasks

## Why?

I've created this CLI app to ease my pain of manually creating each row in the table.

## Usage

You have to have python3 installed on your device.

```bash
python3 main.py -p ... -hrf ...
```

**-p** –– for md path, default is 'README.md' value  
**-s** –– for section Title in your md, if it exists, it will append a new task to it; otherwise, it will create _new_ section with the given name default is ''  
**-hrf** –– for multiple web links of tasks from leetcode you wanted to add
